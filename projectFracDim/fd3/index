Index to the FD3 Package


INDEX			-- This file

README.1st		-- Synopsis of FD3

README.2		-- More complete information on
			   installation and use of FD#

REPORT.INF		-- A sample report like those output by
			   FD3, together with annotations.
			   This is intended to help you learn
			   to interpret the reports output by
			   FD3.

NOTES			-- Some notes on the topic of fractal
			   dimension, reproduced from a talk I
			   gave.  Possibly a useful
			   introduction to the subject.
 			   
copyright		-- A copy of the copyright notice that
			   appears in each of these files.

fd.h			-- The header file for the program

fddriver.c		-- The main program module

fdqueue.c		-- The implementation of the queues
			   used by FD3.

fdutil.c		-- A collection of functions called by
			   the main module in fddriver.c
			   

Some Sample Input Files That Are Included in this Collection:

britain.dat 	-- 1292 points representing the coastline of Great
		   Britain

henon.dat	-- 2500 points of a Henon attractor, obtained by
		   iterating x := 1 - ax^2 + y ; and y := bx,
		   where a = 1.4, b = 0.3, and 0 is the initial
		   value of both x and y.

koch.dat	-- 3073 points of the Koch (snowflake) fractal
		   curve.

logistic.dat    -- 2000 iterations of the logistic equation
                   x := g * x * (1-x), where g = 3.5699456.

can3d.dat 	-- 1000 points in a Cantor (delete middle thirds)
  		   set, embedded in 3D space.

perf.dat	-- an "artifical" 2187 element set cooked up as
		   an example where the information and
		   correlation dimension estimates differ
		   significantly from the capacity dimension
		   estimate.

Along with these *.dat files, are included the corresponding
*.rep files, the reports that fd3 produced when the *.dat files
were used as input.

This allows you to compare what you get on your system with
what we got on ours.

Also, you can compare FD3's results with the results computed
by other programs.

Finally, the capacity dimension of the Koch curve is EXACTLY
log(4)/log(3), and that of the Cantor set is log(2)/log(3).
Compare these with FD3's values.
