Joseph Culberson's Coloring Programs

Version 2.0 as of November 19, 1998.
Minor fixes May 30, 2001.

To make these programs, you will either need to create 
a directory called bin in this directory, or modify
the BINPATH variable in the file makefile to point
where you want the executables.

To make all the programs you should type 
	make all

Alternatively you may make a particular coloring program.

These programs have been compiled on a Sun Sparc 10/40
running UNIX BSD and on a Pentium II using Linux, 
using the GNU gcc compiler.  These systems have 128 MB
of memory.

However, no warranty as to portability is made either to these systems,
or to other systems.

For smaller systems, and systems where "int" is 16 bits,
you may need to modify some of the constants defined in the .h files.
